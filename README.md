Firebase + Electric Imp Demo Apps
==================================
Apps built using Firebase with [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com/). This repo includes two demo apps:

**ImpFirebase-seed**: A starter app for integrating Firebase with Electric Imp. When the button on an Electric Imp device is pressed, this app sends the device ID to Firebase with a button pressed indicator.

**ImpFirebase-HRmonitor**: This app connects a bracelet with an accelerometer to a heart rate monitor. It logs the heart rate in Firebase and the bracelet blinks with every heart beat.
